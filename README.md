# AR-magicbow

Welcome to AR-magicbow, an augmented reality game developed with Unity. This project marks my first attempt at developing an AR game during this course. The game is a first-person shooter set in the world of the magical girl Madoka Magica.

## Features
- Engaging gameplay with a first-person perspective
- Based on the popular anime series Madoka Magica
- Future goals include adding bow and arrow peripherals, as well as introducing new types of monsters

Feel free to explore the world of AR-magicbow and embark on a magical adventure!
